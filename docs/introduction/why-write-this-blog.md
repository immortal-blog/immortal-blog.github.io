# Why write this blog

1. Human memory is very unreliable and easy to forget. Only by recording it permanently in words can you keep your
   memory for a longer time.
2. There are also many good content on the Internet that are worth collecting, but other peopleâ€™s blogs are not
   necessarily stable and reliable. It is possible that they are still there today and will be closed after a few days.
   I have to rely on myself to record reliably. After the knowledge is summarized and sorted out by myself, I also
   understand it more deeply.
3. I hope that I will live forever, but this is not realistic. I hope this is an "immortal" blog that will perpetuate my
   knowledge and memory.
4. This is not my first blog, and maybe it is not the last. There may be different ideas at every stage of life, and not
   all of these ideas are suitable for sharing.
5. This blog is purely a technical blog, recording technical content. Ideas may change, technology is immortal, and
   truth is immortal.
